		This "responsive" web site serves as a home to SokoolTools and is used primarily by its author to <i>
			<b>showcase</b>
		</i> (or more importantly, to <i><b>experiment</b></i> with) the latest Microsoft .NET web technologies.
	</div>
	<div class="mb-2">
		The site has been finely crafted using the following resources: Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 5, Razor, HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap, Popper,
		Font-Awesome, jQuery, jQuery-UI, and more...
	</div>
	<div class="mb-2">
		The data displayed in both the <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Photos" asp-action="Photos1" asp-route-id="0">Photos1</a> view 
		and <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Photos" asp-action="Photos2" asp-route-id="0">Photos2</a> view,
		as well as the <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Videos" asp-action="Index" asp-route-vf="Across">Videos</a> view is generated 'dynamically' by
		the ASP.Net server by reading all assets placed into the designated web folders using high speed parallel processing.
	</div>
	<div class="mb-2">
		The <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Photos" asp-action="Photos1" asp-route-id="0">Photos2</a> view provides a user friendly interface using a Bootstrap photo carousel/slide show.
	</div>
	<div class="mb-2">
		The specific <a href="~/videos/show/across?fn=A%20Little%20Help%20From%20My%20Friends.mp4">Video</a> view utilizes a jQuery-UI <i>draggable</i>, <i>non-modal</i> dialog to display the corresponding lyrics since this is not otherwise possible using BootStrap.<br />
		It also uses a separate BootStrap Tab for categorizing the videos. Some javascript had to be created to correctly activate the current nav tab and the video tab corresponding to the current MVC View.
