Some trails are happy ones, 
Others are blue. 
It's the way you ride the trail that counts, 
Here's a happy one for you. 

Happy trails to you, 
Until we meet again. 
Happy trails to you, 
Keep smilin' until then. 

Who cares about the clouds when we'ere together? 
Just sing a song, and bring the sunny weather. 

Happy trails to you, 
Til we meet again.
