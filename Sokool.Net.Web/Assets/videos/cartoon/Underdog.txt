There's no need to fear, Underdog is here. 

When criminals in this world appear, 
And break the laws that they should fear, 
And frighten all who see or hear, 
The cry goes up both far and near for 
Underdog, 
Underdog, 
Underdog, 
Underdog. 

Speed of lightning, roar of thunder, 
Fighting all who rob or plunder 
Underdog, Underdog. 

When in this world the headlines read 
Of those who's hearts are filled with greed 
And rob and steal from those in need. 
To right this wrong with blinding speed goes 
Underdog, 
Underdog, 
Underdog, 
Underdog. 

Speed of lightning, roar of thunder, 
Fighting all who rob or plunder 
Underdog, Underdog.
