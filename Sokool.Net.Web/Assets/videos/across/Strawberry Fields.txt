Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right, that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.
