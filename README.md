# Sokool.Net.Mvc.Core
Sokool.Net Website (ASP.NET MVC Core)

This "responsive" web site serves as a home to SokoolTools and is used primarily by its author to <i><b>showcase</b></i> (or more importantly, to <i><b>experiment</b></i> with) the latest Microsoft .NET web technologies.

The site has been finely crafted using the following resources: Microsoft ASP.NET MVC Core 3.l, Razor, HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap, Popper, Font-Awesome, jQuery, jQuery-UI, and more...

The data displayed in both the <b>Photos1</b> view and <b>Photos2</b> view,	as well as the <b>Videos</b> view is generated 'dynamically' by the ASP.Net server by reading all assets placed into the designated web folders using high speed parallel processing.

The <b>Photos2</b> view provides a user friendly interface using a Bootstrap photo carousel/slide show.

The specific <b>Videos</b> view utilizes a jQuery-UI <i>draggable</i>, <i>non-modal</i> dialog to display the corresponding lyrics since this is not otherwise possible using BootStrap.

It also uses a separate BootStrap Tab control for categorizing the videos. Some javascript code was added to correctly activate the current nav tab and the tab corresponding to the current MVC View.
